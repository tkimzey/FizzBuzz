A couple assumptions I made:

- In supporting printing sets of non-sequential numbers, the user provided sets don't allow duplicates
(keying off the word "set")
- In supporting user provided tokens and evaluating division against more or less than 2 numbers, duplicate
factors are allowed (2 "Chicken", 2 "Turkey" outputs "ChickenTurkey")
